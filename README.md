# Premium-Calculator
This is a Premium calculator solution. It is developed in .net core, MVC, Razor, jQuery, Bootstrap.

## Assumptions
- I made "Age" a calculated field because "Date of Birth" is already present.
- I set today as max date a user can select as DOB.
- User is presented to choose year first, then month and date as DOB. An attempt to make it user friendly.
- Premiums are rounded to 2 digit after decimal.
- Currency is set as AUD.

## Clarifications
- Premiums are being calculated only on click of "Calculate Premium" button and on select of "Occupation" list.
- UI Design is responsive.
- Latest code is pushed to "**main**" branch.
